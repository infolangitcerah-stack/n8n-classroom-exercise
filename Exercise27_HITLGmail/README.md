📧 Reflection on HITL for Gmail

Working with HITL in Gmail reminded me that AI doesn’t need to be all-or-nothing. Sometimes the most powerful use of AI is when it pauses and waits for us ⏸️👩‍💻. That little Approve ✅ button transforms email from a one-way automation into a two-way collaboration 💌🤝.

It’s not just about sending smarter drafts ✍️ — it’s about respecting human judgment in the loop 🧑‍⚖️. In practice, it means important communications remain both AI-assisted 🤖 and human-approved 🙋.

A simple button, but a profound shift in how trust and responsibility flow between us and our AI teammates 💡.
It reminds me that automation can be safe, mindful, and human-centered when we design it with small but meaningful checkpoints 🌱✨.
