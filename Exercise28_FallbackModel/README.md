# 🔄 Fallback Model

**Reflection:**  
The fallback model taught me about humility — even in code 🔁.

**💭 Lesson Learned:**  
Smart systems don’t fear failure — they plan for it.

The Fallback AI Model in the latest versions of n8n is a feature, typically found in the AI Agent or related nodes, that is designed to increase the reliability of your AI-powered workflows. It is essentially a "Plan B" language model that the workflow automatically switches to if the primary AI model (the one you initially configured) fails to respond or encounters an error.
